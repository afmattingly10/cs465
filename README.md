Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

Express - web server capabilities to make its APIs easier to use and offer useful additional features.it's easy to structure the functionality of your project.
It allows you to render HTML pages dynamically by supplying variables to templates. 

HTML basic functions of a website

JavaScript  Graphical User Experience to your visitors.
JavaScript is now used in game creation, mobile app development, and desktop app development.

A single-page application (SPA) is a single page  with a lot of data that stays the same and only a few bits that need to be changed at once.
.With each click, the SPA just delivers the information you need, and your browser renders it. 

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
Because it allowed for more functiality and organization with the flow between classes. 

Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
They file together through the use of the different programs and how the interfaces are organized. It imporves functioality by doing it this way because it is organized.

Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Testing was done by running local hosts. 

Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
  This course has helped me by showing me a big independent project and time mangament. It showed me to ask for help when needed and to accomplish something from start to finish. I learned a lot about the programs we used and local host and how they sync together to complete the project.
